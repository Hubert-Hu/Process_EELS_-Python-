# Process_EELS_-Python-
Process EELS systematically: align, normalize, PCA, denoise_LLR, plot, find peak.

The main script is 'Process_EELS.py', which includes three classes:  

1. **Line**.  
The instance of the class is an object describing a line of EELS.  
Main function: **slice, plot, find_zlp, align, yshift, spline, integrate, find_peak, denoise_LLR**.

2. **Lines**.  
The instance of the class is an object describing a list of EELS lines.  
Main function: **add, delete, slice, slice_display, align, normalize, denoise_LLR, PCA, make_plot, find_peak, subtract background signals**.

3. **Map**.  
The Child Class of **Lines**.  
Additional function: **normalize_map,sum_in_an_area, mapping_slice_display, PCA_plot**

Examples using these three classes for systematically analyze EELS data are presented:

1. **'Process_EELS_Line.ipynb'**  
Examples of the basic functions based on Line Class:  
1: slice_data  
2: yshift_data  
3: spline  
4: find_zlp_max  
5: denoise_LLR  
6: find_peak

2. **'Process_EELS_Lines.ipynb'**  
Examples of the further analysis based on Lines Class:  
1: Plot multiple lines.  
2: Validation test of the manual background subtraction by finding peaks.  
3: Background subtraction by raw and subtrate data. 

3. **'Process_EELS_Map.ipynb'**  
Examples of the EELS mapping analysis based on Map Class:  
1: Initial process (align, and normalize).  
2: Slice display.  
3: Decomposition by PCA (or NMF).  
4: Summming over all the pixels.  

Any feedback is welcome. Please let me know if you have any questions on bugs or any suggestions to expand the functionality.
